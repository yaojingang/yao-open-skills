description: Create standalone beginner tutorial packages from a topic or supplied references, with adaptive research, course-style outline design, chapter visuals, and Markdown/DOCX/PDF/HTML exports. Use for textbook-like tutorials, course guides, teaching documents, or long beginner guides; not for quick answers, link summaries, pure diagrams, or file conversion.

# Yao Tutorial Skill

## Workflow

1. Normalize topic, audience, outcome, language, formats, user material, style references, and exclusions into `brief.json`.
2. Read `references/input-adaptation.md`; use user material as the spine when sufficient, then add only needed external research.
3. Read `references/research-sourcing.md`; create `research/user-materials-register.md` when needed, `research/source-register.md`, and `research/evidence-map.md`.
4. Read `references/tutorial-outline-and-writing.md` plus `references/course-design-principles.md`; write `outline.md`, standalone public `tutorial.md` using `第1章` and `1.1`, and `research/chapter-quality-review.md`.
5. Read the editorial and visual references; create `visuals/visual-spec.json`, then run `build_visual_pack.py` and `capture_visuals.py`.
6. Read `references/export-workflow.md`; run `export_tutorial.py` and then `validate_package.py`.
7. Report exact failures and fallbacks. Never fabricate X posts, papers, repo details, dates, or citations.

## Quality Gates

- User material controls intent when strong enough; external evidence fills verification and gaps.
- Public exports never show internal source IDs or reference-packet provenance.
- Copy reads as a standalone formal teaching product.
- Every numbered chapter has a matching visual spec and embedded visual.
- Depth is governed by learning sufficiency, not a fixed word limit; continue until the learner can understand, apply, and self-check the topic.
- Every numbered chapter has an independent quality review for depth, examples, practice, evidence, visual fit, and back-half consistency.
- HTML uses centered `report-shell`; DOCX/PDF have no visible headers, footers, local paths, or print chrome.
- Delivery passes `scripts/validate_package.py` or names the remaining warnings/failures.
